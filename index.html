    <p>
  que1::Add two NumbersYou are provided with two numbers A and B.
      Your task is to add these two numbers. <br><br>

<pre>
    const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
        return (a + b);
    };
</pre>
    
      
    
    
    <br><br>

    que2::Find if the conditions are obeyed or not?You are given two number
         first as A and second as B and check if both conditions (A<10 and A>B)
       are satisfied or not with the help of operators.
   
<pre>
    const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {
        return (a<10 ) && (a>b)? true:false
         
       };
</pre>
   <br><br>
   
     que3::Check the conditons You are given two numbers A and B.
           You need to do the following checks:
    1) if both are divisible by 10 console true.
       2) if both are not divisible by 10 console false.
       3) if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.
       <br><br>
    <pre>
        const Check = (A, B) => 
        {
           
           if(A%10 == 0 && B%10 == 0){
             return true;
           }

 que4::Find the first digit of a 4 digit number You are provided a four 
       digit number N only.Your task is to print out the first digit of 
       that number.   
   

<pre>
    const First_Digit = (n) => {
   
        return parseInt(n/1000);
          
       };

 que5::Find the last digit of a 4 digit number You are provided a four digit
       number N only. Your task is to print out the last digit of that number.

<pre>const Last_Digit = (n) => {
  
    return parseInt(n%10);
     
  };
</pre>

  que6:: Find the remainder You are provided with two numbers A and B
         A as  divisor and B as  dividend.Your task is find the remainder.
 
 
<pre>const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) => {
    
    return  (b%a)
     
     
 };
</pre>
